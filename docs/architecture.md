# YouTube Commenter Architecture

## System Overview

The YouTube Commenter application allows users to:
1. Log in with their YouTube account
2. Monitor comments on their videos in real-time
3. Generate AI-powered replies to comments
4. Keep a history of all comments and replies
5. Reference back to original YouTube comments

## Components

### Backend (Rust with Axum, Tokio, SurrealDB)

1. **Authentication Service**
   - Handles YouTube OAuth2 authentication
   - Manages user sessions and tokens
   - Stores user credentials securely

2. **YouTube API Service**
   - Fetches comments from user's videos
   - Posts replies to comments
   - Monitors for new comments in real-time
   - Handles YouTube API rate limiting

3. **AI Reply Service**
   - Generates contextual replies to comments
   - Allows customization of reply style/tone
   - Maintains conversation history for context

4. **Database Service (SurrealDB)**
   - Stores comment and reply history
   - Maintains user preferences
   - Logs all interactions for reference

5. **WebSocket Service**
   - Provides real-time updates to the frontend
   - Notifies of new comments
   - Streams AI reply generation progress

### Frontend (Flutter)

1. **Authentication UI**
   - Login screen with YouTube OAuth
   - User profile management
   - Session management

2. **Dashboard**
   - Overview of recent comments across videos
   - Statistics on reply rates and engagement
   - Quick access to pending replies

3. **Comment Monitor**
   - Real-time feed of incoming comments
   - Filtering and sorting options
   - Notification system

4. **Reply Interface**
   - AI-generated reply suggestions
   - Editing capabilities before posting
   - Quick reply templates

5. **History Log**
   - Searchable history of all comments and replies
   - Filtering by video, date, sentiment
   - Direct links back to YouTube comments

## Data Flow

1. User authenticates with YouTube account
2. Backend fetches initial comments and sets up real-time monitoring
3. New comments trigger notifications to the frontend
4. User can request AI-generated replies for any comment
5. Replies can be edited and then posted back to YouTube
6. All interactions are logged in the database
7. History view allows reviewing past interactions with links back to YouTube

## Technical Considerations

1. **Security**
   - Secure storage of OAuth tokens
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Data encryption for sensitive information

2. **Performance**
   - Efficient real-time updates
   - Optimized database queries
   - Background processing for AI generation

3. **Scalability**
   - Handle multiple YouTube channels per user
   - Support for high comment volume
   - Efficient storage of historical data
