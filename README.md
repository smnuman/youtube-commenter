- View replies to comments
- Analyze comment data
- Store comment data in SurrealDB

## Development Log

### Project Pivot
- Switching from Node.js to Rust with Flutter frontend
- Will use Axum for the web framework
- Will use Tokio for async runtime
- Will use SurrealDB for the database

### Current Status
- Git repository is set up
- Project is being restructured for Rust and Flutter

### Next Steps
- Install Rust and set up Cargo project
- Add necessary Rust dependencies
- Implement backend with Axum and Tokio
- Set up SurrealDB integration
- Create Flutter frontend

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Rust (with Cargo)
- Flutter SDK
- SurrealDB
